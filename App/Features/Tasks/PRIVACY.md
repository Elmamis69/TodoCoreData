# Tasko Privacy Policy

Tasko does not collect personal information on its own servers.

All data you enter (tasks, notes, due dates, completion status) is stored locally on your device using Apple's Core Data framework. If you enable iCloud sync in a future version, your data may be stored in your private iCloud account, which is managed by Apple. We (the developer) do not have access to that data.

Tasko requests permission to send local notifications. These notifications are scheduled entirely on-device and are only used to remind you about tasks you created. You can turn notifications off at any time in iOS Settings.

We do not track you, sell data, or use analytics.

If you want to remove all your data from Tasko, you can delete the app from your device. This removes the locally stored data.
